# kjhnet

Some network data, for teaching purposes. 

- Iliad data are from Gabriel Rossman (2017) "[Glory and Gore](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1536504217732052)", *Contexts* 16(3):42--47. Original data files available at <https://osf.io/jasf4/>.

- Sociology Top 25 Jobs data are from John Robert Warren, (2019) "How Much Do You Have to Publish to Get a Job in a Top Sociology Department? Or to Get Tenure? Trends Over a Generation", *Sociological Science* February 27, 2019 doi://10.15195/v6.a7. Original data files available at <https://www.rob-warren.com/pub_trends.html>. 


## Installation

`kjhnet` is a data package. 

### Install direct from GitHub

You can install the beta version of kjhnet from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjhnet) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kjhealy/kjhnet")
```


## Loading the data

The package works best with the [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph), [tidygraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph), and broader [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) libraries.

```{r libs}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)
```

Load the data:

```{r load}
library(kjhnet)
```

## Example

Some off-label use of Rob Warren's Top 25 Sociology Jobs data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)

set_graph_style(family = "Myriad Pro SemiCondensed")

clean_dept_names <- function(x){
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "California-", "")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "SUNY-", "")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "SUNY-", "")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "Illinois-Chicago", "UIC")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "U of Illinois", "UIUC")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "U of Pennsylvania", "U Penn")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "San Francisco", "UCSF")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "North Carolina", "UNC")
    x <- stringr::str_replace(x, "N.C. State", "NC State")
